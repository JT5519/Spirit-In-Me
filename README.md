# Enemy AI Behavior
The enemy AI behavior is implemented by a 2 layer behavior system. Layer 1 is the state (similar to emotional state in humans) layer and is less volatile and does not change moment to moment. Layer 2 is the behavior layer that controls the moment to moment actions of the AI, and this layer is influenced by layer 1.
